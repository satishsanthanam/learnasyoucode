<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Stroke:</strong> When a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain gets blocked</h1>
<h2>Background:</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A blocked or burst blood vessel that supplies blood to a part of the brain causes a <strong>stroke</strong>, also known as a <strong>brain attack</strong>. Both scenarios result in damage to certain parts of the brain. Parts of the brain can become paralyzed. A stroke can cause permanent brain damage, long-term disability, or death. A stroke is the third-most common cause of death in the world.</p>
<h2>What are the types of strokes?</h2>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Ischemic stroke:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">This occurs when a blood vessel becomes blocked and causes the blood vessels in part of the brain to become paralyzed.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Haemorrhagic stroke:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">This stroke occurs when a blood vessel ruptures and bleeds into brain tissue and causes tissue damage.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Another type of stroke, known as a "Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)", is characterized by the onset of stroke symptoms that spontaneously resolve upon restoration of the blood supply. Many times, TIAs occur days or weeks before the actual stroke. Therefore, it acts as a warning sign for a future stroke. Identifying and treating TIAs can help prevent major strokes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">During a stroke, a ruptured blood vessel blocks the brain's energy supply, depriving it of the constant supply of oxygen and nutrients it requires. This causes the death of nerve cells within minutes. Each half of the brain controls the opposite half of the body. A stroke on the right side of the brain causes problems on the left side of the body, and a stroke on the left side of the body causes problems on the right side of the body.</p>
<h2>What are the risk factors for stroke?</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We can classify stroke risk factors as modifiable (changeable) and non-modifiable (unchangeable). Modifiable risk factors include high blood pressure (&gt;140/90), diabetes mellitus, lack of sleep, stress, obesity, smoking, elevated plasma lipids, lack of exercise, oral contraceptive pills, heart disease, and abnormal heart rate. Modifiable risk factors include older age, gender, ethnicity, and history of previous strokes.</p>
<h2>What are the symptoms of a stroke?</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The symptoms of a stroke vary. Any of the following factors could trigger a stroke.</p>
<ul>
<li>One side of the body typically experiences weakness or numbness in the face, arm, or leg.</li>
<li>The individual is experiencing difficulty speaking or understanding.</li>
<li>One or both eyes may experience vision issues, leading to blurred or lost vision.</li>
<li>Symptoms may include dizziness, problems with balance or coordination, and vomiting.</li>
<li>Problems with movement or walking</li>
<li>Fainting (loss of consciousness) or seizures</li>
<li>Severe headache for no apparent reason, especially if it comes on suddenly.</li>
<li>The acronym <strong>BEFAST</strong> can identify stroke symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">B is for balance&mdash;a sudden loss of balance or coordination.<br /> E stands for eyes&mdash;sudden blurring, double vision, or loss of vision.<br /> F is for face drooping&mdash;one side of the person&rsquo;s face droops or is numb.<br /> A is for arm weakness&mdash;one of the person&rsquo;s arms is weak, numb, or doesn&rsquo;t move at all.<br /> S stands for speech difficulty, which is characterized by slurs or difficulty forming words.<br /> T is for time to call&mdash;if the person shows any of these symptoms.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Note the onset time of any of these symptoms and seek immediate medical attention.</p>
<h2>Stroke treatment:</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Treatment includes immediate evaluation, medical care, surgery, and hospice care. As soon as a suspicion of stroke arises, CT or MRI imaging becomes imperative. Whether the type of stroke is ischemic (due to a blood vessel blockage) or hemorrhagic,</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Medical:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">To dissolve clots and restore blood supply, eligible patients can receive tissue plasminogen activator if they arrive at the hospital within 4.5 hours of the onset of symptoms. We only use this in cases of ischemic strokes.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Surgery or intervention:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">A medical procedure called mechanical thrombectomy clears a large clot from a blood vessel by using endovascular techniques to remove the clot and get blood flowing again. All eligible patients can undergo this procedure within 24 hours of symptom onset.</p>
